# Human Activity Recognition(HAR)
In this project inpendentcies,
- python 3.7 (but it's also work, if you use python 3.6)
- tensroflow (version 2 but in the code already change compatibility to version 1)
- pandas

Before you run the code,
1. make directory for data set named 'data' in the project directory.
2. set Virtualenv that has all inpenndencies.

Enjoy!
