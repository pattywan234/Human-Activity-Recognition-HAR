# Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- python 3.7 (but it's also work, if you use python 3.6)
- tensroflow (version 2 but in the code already change compatibility to version 1)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Keras
- seaborn
- sklearn
Before you run the code,
1. make directory for data set named 'data' in the project directory. In 'data' directory must has 'CNN-data' and 'LSTM-data' directory.
2. set Virtualenv that has all inpenndencies.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
